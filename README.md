## Introduction

Anitube is a beloved platform among anime enthusiasts, offering a diverse collection of anime series, movies, and OVAs. As part of my developer journey, I've undertaken this project to reimagine the Anitube API using modern software engineering principles.

## Project Goals

1. **Recreate API**: Develop a new API for Anitube, focusing on architecture and functionality.
2. **Monolithic Architecture**: Initially implement the API using a monolithic architecture for simplicity and rapid development.
3. **Decompose as Needed**: Gradually decompose the monolithic architecture into microservices as the project evolves, demonstrating a deep understanding of architectural patterns.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the API can handle increased traffic and data volume without compromising performance or user experience.
5. **Flexibility**: Design the API to be flexible, allowing for the seamless addition of new features and modifications as per user feedback.
6. **Modularity**: Break down the application into loosely coupled modules to facilitate maintenance and updates, showcasing proficiency in software design.
7. **Modern Technologies**: Utilize modern technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Docker, and Kubernetes, highlighting familiarity with industry-standard tools and frameworks.
8. **Responsive to Demands**: Continuously monitor and adapt the API to meet evolving demands and expectations, demonstrating an agile development mindset.

## Architecture Overview

The initial architecture of the Anitube API will be monolithic, emphasizing simplicity and rapid development. However, as the project matures, the architecture will evolve to embrace microservices, showcasing my ability to adapt to changing requirements and implement scalable solutions.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies will be utilized in the development of the Anitube API:

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **API Documentation**: Swagger, OpenAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
